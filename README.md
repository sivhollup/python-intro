Some simple code to follow up on CodeCombat-gaming

## Get up and running
Download the code file `Hero.py` from this repository to a directory where you want to have all your Python code. 

You must add that directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable (milj√∏variabel). If you don't have a PYTHONPATH, make one. Ask instructors for help on this, or google it. 

Open Idle. In the command prompt, import the module by typing 

`import Hero`

Now you can create your own hero with 

`hero = Hero.Hero()`

or 

`hero = Hero.Hero2(5, 5)`

or 

`hero = Hero.Hero3((0,0), 5, 5)`

Hero, Hero2 and Hero3 are three different variations, Hero3 is the one where the move-functions will be most similar to CodeCombat.
